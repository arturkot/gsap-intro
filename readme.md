# [GSAP intro animation](http://codepen.io/arturkot/full/akRKVm/)

This repo stores files for a animation which you can watch on [this Codepen page](http://codepen.io/arturkot/full/akRKVm/).

## Local Setup

You can ran local server, play around with the repo, and preview your changes. üëç

### Instructions

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install NodeJS (tested on v5).
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start`.
5. The [Codepen demo page](http://codepen.io/arturkot/full/akRKVm/) should open up in you defaut browser with animation loaded from your local repo served from [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Caveats

* Please make sure that you don't have any other servers running on `localhost:3000` ‚Äì that would not allow to start the local server with the animation.
* Livereloading isn't supported at the moment. That means you'll have to refresh Codepen's page to see your local adjustments.

# Questions you may have

### Why the animation has to be played on Codepen?

Because of 2 paid plugins I've used: [MorphSVGPlugin](http://greensock.com/morphSVG) and [SplitText](http://greensock.com/SplitText). I can't include them in this open-for-everyone repo _but_ they are available for public use on Codepen!


### What's GSAP?

Short answer: probably _the best animation library for JS_. ;) Want more information? Go to the [library's homepage](http://greensock.com/).
